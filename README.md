### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Most of my GitHub contributions are either within my organisation or within personal private repositories, so the stats/content that you see here isn't entirely representative of my work!

If you're a colleague of mine, you might like to view my [Communications Readme](/CommunicationsReadme.md).

Expect to see some more interesting collaborations appearing here in the near future ðŸ˜„

### Slightly more about me

As well as the links in my GitHub profile, here are some other places that you might find me contributing online:

- [ðŸ“˜ Finding Mojovation - my debut book on Leanpub!](https://leanpub.com/mojovation)
- [ðŸ’¼ LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neilstudd)
- [ðŸŽ¥ Letterboxd profile](https://letterboxd.com/dustlined/)

<!--
**neilstudd/neilstudd** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
