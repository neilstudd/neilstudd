## Communications readme: Neil Studd

### Version History

- **29th November 2021:** Revamp for Elucidat (primarily making it UK-centric).
- **12th July 2021:** Initial draft prior to joining Postman.

### Why do I have a Readme?

Everyone is different, everyone has different things which make them tick, different things that annoy them and different preferences for communication. Iâ€™d like to give anyone who needs to know, an insight into how I work best and how to get the best out of me when you need me to do something. _(You can find out a bit more about the concept of a Communications Readme by viewing [this article on my blog](https://blog.neilstudd.com/readme).)_

### How best to communicate with me?

- **Open (virtual) door policy.** If you need anything - even if it's just a burning desire for a chat - please just let me know. If I'm not immediately available, I'll at least suggest the soonest available good time. This will almost always be the same day, unless it's very late.
- **No surprises.** I don't like to receive incoming calls without knowing what they're about. Please DM me beforehand with brief details of what it's regarding; I may request to get back to you later in the day, if I'm deeply focused.
- **Tell me if it's urgent.** If you need me urgently, the same applies above: please DM, and say it's urgent! I'm more than willing to drop everything if you tell me that it's necessary.
- **Trust my status.** I actively manage my status indicator. Green = open to chat. Red = busy/focused. Away = away/BRB. Offline = offline! I will add detail in the status message, especially regarding my return time.
- **I prefer camera on, but I'll follow your lead.** I like to use my webcam, but I appreciate that everybody is different. So I'll usually follow this logic:
    - ****In large meetings:** I will follow whatever the majority is doing.
    - **If I start a private call:** I'll put my camera on. Don't feel pressured to do the same, it's your choice.
    - **If I join your private call:** I am happy to match whatever camera setting you are using.

### How do you book a meeting with me?

- **Typical working hours: 08:00-17:00.** Immediately after this time, I have some childcare responsibilities (nursery collection, dinner, bath and bedtime!) so 5pm is often a "hard stop" for me; I can usually make extra time available in the evening for something critical. 
- **Low availability on Tuesday afternoons.** I work a half-day on Tuesdays to help look after my son, and to buy my wife some time for herself. I'll still be responsive to incoming messages whenever possible, but I'm unlikely to be able to jump onto a call unless it's urgent.
- **Mobile best for out-of-hours emergencies.** I try to avoid checking email/Slack out-of-hours, although it's often a losing battle. Nevertheless, if there is an emergency, a phonecall/SMS is the best way to guarantee getting hold of me.
- **Send me a calendar invite.** I manage my daily workflow (and interruptions) via my calendar, so for any significant-length chats, please send me a meeting invite. This helps to ensure that others are not trying to contact me at the same time, and I can give you the attention that you deserve ðŸ˜Š

### Icebreaker topics

- **Films.** I am a bit of a movie buff - I have seen over 3,000 movies and I review/rate them online. On average, I aim to watch a film a day. So if you'd like to talk about a film, or send/receive recommendations, I'm always willing to chat!
- **Kids.** I have a son, Gus, who is approaching two years old. He has brought delightful chaos to our lives. I'm always happy to share our best/worst recent experiences, or hear about yours!
- **Weather.** I'm British, so always happy to talk about the weather, especially with those in vastly different climates.

### What makes me tick?

- **Challenges.** I like problems, as they allow me to harness creativity to solve them.
- **Autonomy.** I like the freedom to find my own solution to a problem, and to learn from mistakes. (That said, I also like to learn from the experiences of others, so don't be afraid to offer your own steering suggestions; but I reserve the right to follow my own path.)
- **Family.** My family are the most important thing in the world to me. I am passionate about work, but the purpose of my work is to create opportunities to do more interesting things with them in my free time.

### What quirks do I have which you should be aware of?

- **If you're desperate for a reply, don't sit in silence.** I practice Inbox Zero, and check my mail/DMs every day (unless my Out Of Office says otherwise). If you haven't received a reply from me within 24 hours, this means I don't believe a follow-up is required. If you are expecting a response, please @ me in a reply (especially if it's a long thread with many recipients - see the "frustrations" section below).
- **I'm OCD about to-do lists.** Similar to the above, I'm very driven by task lists, and the completion of objectives. If my lists grow too long, I may block-out some calendar time to prevent myself from becoming overwhelmed. Please bear this in mind if giving me new tasks when I am already openly juggling several other tasks.
- **I actively try to avoid over-working.** I have a history of over-working which has sometimes spilled over into burnout. Because of this, I am now strict with myself in ensuring I take time back if I work many extra hours in the preceding day. Please be supportive and understanding with this.
- **I have a full house on Mondays/Tuesdays.** My wife and son are both at home on Mondays and Tuesdays. Although I have an isolated office in the garden, there may still be occasional mini-emergencies which drag me away suddenly for a few minutes.

### Things that frustrate me

- **Long-running email chains with dozens of recipients.** I would rather sit through a 30-minute meeting to resolve an issue, if the alternative is dozens of micro-interruptions from new emails.
- **Be direct with your DMs.** Private message notifications break my flow, so if you need me, please try to summarise in your opening message to reduce the number of distractions. (Kudos to [NoHello.net](https://nohello.net/) for helping to share the message!)
