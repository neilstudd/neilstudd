### Why do I have a Readme?

Everyone is different, everyone has different things which make them tick, different things that annoy them and different preferences for communication. Iâ€™d like to give anyone who needs to know, an insight into how I work best and how to get the best out of me when you need me to do something. _(You can find out a bit more about the concept of a Communications Readme by viewing [this article on my blog](https://mojovation.co.uk/2022/08/22/whats-in-your-communications-readme.html).)_

### How best to communicate with me?

- **Open (virtual) door policy.** If you need anything - even if it's just a chat - please just DM me. I'll work to find the soonest available good time; this will almost always be the same day.
- **No surprises.** I don't like to receive incoming calls without knowing what they're about. Please DM me beforehand with brief details of what it's regarding; I may request to get back to you later in the day, if I'm deeply focused.
- **Tell me if it's urgent.** If you need me urgently, the same applies above: please DM, and say it's urgent! I'm more than willing to drop everything if you tell me that it's necessary.
- **Trust my status.** I actively manage my status indicator. If it says I'm available/away/offline, this is 99% accurate. For daytime breaks, I will include an estimated return time in my status.
- **I prefer camera on, but I'll follow your lead.** I like to use my webcam, but I appreciate that everybody is different. So I'll usually follow this logic:
    - **In large meetings:** I will follow whatever the majority is doing.
    - **If I start a private call:** I'll put my camera on. Don't feel pressured to do the same, it's your choice.
    - **If I join your private call:** I am happy to match whatever camera setting you are using.

### How do you book a meeting with me?

- **Typical working hours: 08:00-17:00.** After this time, I have childcare responsibilities, so 5pm is often a "hard stop", but if it's critical then I can make extra time available in the evening.
- **Please override Slack notifications if urgent.** I turn off my Slack notifications out-of-hours, so I won't see your message until the morning. If it's an emergency, please DM me and click the option to override my do not disturb setting.
- **Send me a calendar invite.** I manage my daily workflow (and interruptions) via my calendar, so for any significant-length chats, please send me a meeting invite. This helps to ensure that others are not trying to contact me at the same time, and I can give you the attention that you deserve ðŸ˜Š

### Icebreaker topics

- **Films.** I am a bit of a movie buff - I have seen over 3,000 movies and I review/rate them online. So if you'd like to talk about a film, or send/receive recommendations, I'm always willing to chat!
- **Peloton.** I was already a bit of a gym spin class addict before the pandemic, and that's only grown stronger after getting a Peloton bike at home. I'm rather addicted to all of the stats and challenges that it offers.
- **Kids.** I have a son, Gus, a very opinionated two-year-old. He has brought delightful chaos to our lives. Whenever we speak, it's likely that he's done something bizarre in the past couple of hours.

### What makes me tick?

- **Challenges.** I like problems, as they allow me to harness creativity to solve them.
- **Autonomy.** I like the freedom to find my own solution to a problem, and to learn from mistakes. (That said, I also like to learn from the experiences of others, so don't be afraid to offer your own steering suggestions; but I reserve the right to follow my own path.)
- **Family.** My family are the most important thing in the world to me. I am passionate about work, but the purpose of my work is to create opportunities to do more interesting things with them in my free time.

### What quirks do I have which you should be aware of?

- **If you're desperate for a reply, don't sit in silence.** I practice Inbox Zero, and check my mail/DMs every day (unless my Out Of Office says otherwise). If you haven't received a reply from me within 24 hours, this means I don't believe a follow-up is required. If you are expecting a response, please @ me in a reply (especially if it's a long thread with many recipients - see the "frustrations" section below).
- **I'm OCD about to-do lists.** Similar to the above, I'm very driven by task lists, and the completion of objectives. If my lists grow too long, I may block-out some calendar time to prevent myself from becoming overwhelmed. Please bear this in mind if giving me new tasks when I am already openly juggling several other tasks.
- **I actively try to avoid over-working.** I have a history of over-working which has sometimes spilled over into burnout. Because of this, I am now strict with myself in ensuring I take overtime back at a convenient point. Please be supportive and understanding with this.
- **I have a full house on Mondays/Tuesdays.** My wife and son are both at home on Mondays and Tuesdays. Although I have an isolated office in the garden, there may still be occasional mini-emergencies which drag me away suddenly for a few minutes.

### Things that frustrate me

- **Long-running email chains with dozens of recipients.** I would rather sit through a 30-minute meeting to resolve an issue, if the alternative is dozens of micro-interruptions from new emails.
- **Be direct with your DMs.** Private message notifications break my flow, so if you need me, please try to summarise in your opening message to reduce the number of distractions. (Kudos to [NoHello.net](https://nohello.net/) for helping to share the message!)
